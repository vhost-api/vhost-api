[WIP]

This project is in very early stages of development.



vhost-api
=========

Provides an interface that simplifies management of typical vhost-based
webhosting tasks.

Core features:
	* managing clients (admin, reseller, client)
	* managing client-based API tokens for authentication
	* managing virtual hosts and php-fpm pools (apache2, php5)
	* managing sftp accounts 
	* managing email domains, aliases, send-as permissions (postfix+dovecot)
	* managing DNS (limited to powerdns http api for now)
	* managing MySQL databases and users for clients
	* assigning features, limits/quotas, domains to clients
	* (more to come...)

The database layout and service configurations are prepared for integration
with other applications. Example configurations for integrating Roundcube
webmail into this setup will be provided (including support for changing
password, vacation autoresponder and custom filter settings using 
pigeonhole/sieve).


The goal is to provide a system administrator with an application, that eases
management of webhosting tasks and gives a certain amount of freedom to
reseller accounts, enabling them to perform more tasks without the need for
an admin with super user privileges.


This application provides the core API and can be used standalone using HTTP
calls using a tool or library of your choice.
However this API is streamlined to be used in cojunction with vhost-api-web,
which provides a webinterface for all the features of this project.
